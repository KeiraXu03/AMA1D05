**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
Action Function (Actor);: $$ [ \pi(als, theta) textl, where jtheta ltext are the parameters of the actor network}] $$Value Function (Critic): $$[ V^\pi(s) \text{, approximated by the critic network}] $$
.Actor Loss: $$ [ LAtheta) = -\log(pil(als, (theta)) \cdot A(s, a) ]$$ Where (A(s, a)) is the advantage function, computed as
(r + Î³V(s )- V(s)).
Critic Loss: $ L(w) = Wleftlr + [gamma V(s, w) - V(s, w)\right)^2 $ Where (w) are the parameters of the critic networkThese methods provide robust frameworks for solving complex reinforcement learning problems, particularly in environments with large or
